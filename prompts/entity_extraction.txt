-Goal-
Given a genomics textbook or study document and a list of relevant biological entity types, identify and describe all such entities and their functional or clinical relationships.

-Steps-
1. Identify all named entities. For each, extract:
- entity_name: Capitalized name (e.g., BRCA1, TP53, Intron 1)
- entity_type: One of the following: [{entity_types}] (e.g., gene, variant, transcript, SNP, regulatory element, protein, pathway, phenotype, disease)
- entity_description: detailed description of biological role, activity, or relevance

Format each entity as:
("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. Identify relationships between entities, such as functional interaction, regulatory control, disease linkage, or pathway co-membership.
For each:
- source_entity
- target_entity
- relationship_description: explanation of the biological connection
- relationship_strength: numerical score (1â€“10) based on emphasis or clarity in the source

Format as:
("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return the list of entities and relationships, separated by **{record_delimiter}**

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}
